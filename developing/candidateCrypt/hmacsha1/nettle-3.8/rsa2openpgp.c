/* According to RFC 2440, a public key consists of the following packets:
 *
 * Public key packet
 *
 * Zero or more revocation signatures
 *
 * One or more User ID packets
 *
 * After each User ID packet, zero or more signature packets
 *
 * Zero or more Subkey packets
 *
 * After each Subkey packet, one signature packet, optionally a
 * revocation.

 * Currently, we generate a public key packet, a single user id, and a
