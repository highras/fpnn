  /* From Daniel Bleichenbacher (via coderpunks):
   *
   * There is still a theoretical attack possible with 8 extra bits.
   * But, the attack would need about 2^66 signatures 2^66 memory and
   * 2^66 time (if I remember that correctly). Compare that to DSA,
   * where the attack requires 2^22 signatures 2^40 memory and 2^64
   * time. And of course, the numbers above are not a real threat for
   * PGP. Using 16 extra bits (i.e. generating a 176 bit random number
   * and reducing it modulo q) will defeat even this theoretical
   * attack.
   * 
   * More generally log_2(q)/8 extra bits are enough to defeat my
   * attack. NIST also plans to update the standard.
   */

  /* Add a few bits extra, to decrease the bias from the final modulo
   * operation. NIST FIPS 186-3 specifies 64 extra bits, for use with
   * DSA. */
