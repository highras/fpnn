/* Points on a curve are represented as arrays of mp_limb_t, with
   curve-specific representation. For the secp curves, we use Jacobian
   coordinates (possibly in Montgomery form for mod multiplication).
   For curve25519 we use homogeneous coordinates on an equivalent
   Edwards curve. The suffix "_h" denotes this internal
   representation.
   
   Since we use additive notation for the groups, the infinity point
   on the curve is denoted 0. The infinity point can be represented
   with x = y = 0 in affine coordinates, and Z = 0 in Jacobian
   coordinates. However, note that most of the ECC functions do *not*
   support infinity as an input or output.
