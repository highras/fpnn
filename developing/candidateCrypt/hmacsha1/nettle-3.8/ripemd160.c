/*********************************
 * RIPEMD-160 is not patented, see (as of 2011-08-28)
 *   http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html
 * Note that the code uses Little Endian byteorder, which is good for
 * 386 etc, but we must add some conversion when used on a big endian box.
 *
 *
 * Pseudo-code for RIPEMD-160
 *
 * RIPEMD-160 is an iterative hash function that operates on 32-bit words.
 * The round function takes as input a 5-word chaining variable and a 16-word
 * message block and maps this to a new chaining variable. All operations are
 * defined on 32-bit words. Padding is identical to that of MD4.
 *
