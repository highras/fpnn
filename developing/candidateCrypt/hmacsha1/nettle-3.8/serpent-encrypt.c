/* This file is derived from cipher/serpent.c in Libgcrypt v1.4.6.
   The adaption to Nettle was made by Simon Josefsson on 2010-12-07
   with final touches on 2011-05-30.  Changes include replacing
   libgcrypt with nettle in the license template, renaming
   serpent_context to serpent_ctx, renaming u32 to uint32_t, removing
   libgcrypt stubs and selftests, modifying entry function prototypes,
   using FOR_BLOCKS to iterate through data in encrypt/decrypt, using
   LE_READ_UINT32 and LE_WRITE_UINT32 to access data in
   encrypt/decrypt, and running indent on the code. */
